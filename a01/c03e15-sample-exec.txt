Please enter a string with five characters.
The second and fourth characters will be identified.
ab^Dde

Character #2 is b.
Character #4 is d.

What happens if the third character is the EOF character?
	If the EOF character is entered as the third character, the for loop will exit and the fourth character will not be read.  In UNIX the EOF character is ^D; however, I was not able to reproduce this behaviour with gcc 5.3.1 on Fedora 23.
